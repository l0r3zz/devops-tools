# YAML
# Template for generic roles
# This file is in a form that can be read by the very simple YAML parser
# That is a part of phaktor, it is designed to be able to read a generic
# Template file, no validation is performed, basically it's used as a list
# of facts that will be gathered for the role that is running phaktor at the
# time.
---
# Top level is a "dict" with  two key mappings  "meta" is a dict containing control mappings
# whereas "body" contains mappings of the actual facts gathered from phaktor".
# Phaktor only cares about the "body" dict and only reads the keys to populate values for 
# the audit records that it writes. The value side is ignored.
