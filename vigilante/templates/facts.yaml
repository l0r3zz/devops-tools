#YAML
# Template for generic roles
# This file is in a form that can be read by the very simple YAML parser
# That is a part of phaktor, it is designed to be able to read a generic
# Template file, no validation is performed, basically it's used as a list
# of facts that will be gathered for the role that is running phaktor at the
# time.
